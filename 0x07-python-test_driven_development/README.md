Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process where developers write tests for their code before writing the actual code itself.
The tests serve as a guide for the implementation and ensure that the code works as expected.

The process involves the following steps:
1. Write a test for a specific functionality.
2. Run the test and confirm that it fails (since the code being tested hasn't been written yet).
3. Write the code to make the test pass.
4. Repeat the process for other functionality.
5. TDD helps to catch bugs early in the development process and ensures that the code is maintainable, as the tests serve as documentation and regression tests for the code.
